INTRODUCTION					*gorilla-script*
						*gorilla-script-introduction*

This plugin adds support for GorillaScript syntax, indenting, and compiling.
Also included is an eco syntax and support for GorillaScript in HTML.

COMMANDS					*gorilla-script-commands*

						*:GorillaMake*
:GorillaMake[!] {opts}	Wrapper around |:make| that also passes options in
                        |g:gorilla_make_options| to the compiler. Use |:silent|
                        to hide compiler output. See |:make| for more
                        information about [!] and other helpful commands.

						*:GorillaCompile*
:[range]GorillaCompile [vertical] [{win-size}]
			Shows how the current file or [range] is compiled
			to JavaScript. [vertical] (or vert) splits the
			compile buffer vertically instead of horizontally, and
			{win-size} sets the initial size of the buffer. It can
			be closed quickly with the "q" key.

:GorillaCompile {watch} [vertical] [{win-size}]
			The watch mode of :GorillaCompile emulates the "Try
			GorillaScript" live preview on the GorillaScript web
			site. After making changes to the source file,
			exiting insert mode will cause the preview buffer to
			update automatically. {watch} should be given as
                        "watch" or "unwatch," where the latter will stop the
                        automatic updating. [vertical] is recommended, and
                        'scrollbind' is useful.

						*:GorillaRun*
:[range]GorillaRun	Compiles the file or [range] and runs the resulting
			JavaScript, displaying the output.

SETTINGS					*gorilla-script-settings*

You can configure plugin behavior using global variables and syntax commands
in your |vimrc|.

Global Settings~
						*g:gorilla_compiler*
Set the path to the compiler used by |GorillaMake| and |GorillaCompile| (it's
{gorilla} by default.)
>
	let gorilla_compiler = '/usr/bin/gorilla'
<
						*g:gorilla_make_options*
Set default options |GorillaMake| should pass to the compiler.
>
	let gorilla_make_options = '--bare'
<
						*g:gorilla_compile_vert*
Split the GorillaCompile buffer vertically by default.
>
	let gorilla_compile_vert = 1
<
Syntax Highlighting~
						*ft-gorilla-script-syntax*
Trailing whitespace is highlighted as an error by default. This can be
disabled with:
>
	hi link gorillaSpaceError NONE

COMPILER					*compiler-gorilla-script*

A GorillaScript compiler is provided as a wrapper around {gorilla} and can be
loaded with;
>
    compiler gorilla

This is done automatically when a GorillaScript file is opened if no other
compiler is loaded.
