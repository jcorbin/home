- continue exploring the post-tmux lifestyle afforded by "vimux" (neovim `:terminal` for $most things)
  - assisted by shifting most of what I do at the terminal (*cough* git *cough*) over to vim-fugitive
- automated install or vendoring of nvr
- maybe it's time to revamp / reboot zsh config... or switch to bash...
- port deporder to Go (this is already done and laying around $somewhere)
  - eliminates python virtualenv interactions
  - faster, better, stronger...
