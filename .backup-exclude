# exclude patterns for $HOME backups
# see FILTER RULES in rsync(1) for details
# may be specified within any subdirectory

# NOTE you could try to fight a loosing battle against cache directories like:
#   /.cache
#   /.cargo
#   /.npm
#   /go/pkg/mod/cache
#
# but good luck with things like:
# - every electron app, like discord, has one
# - every browser, every profile, its cache... maybe local storage...
# - do you run wine? do you run browsers under it?
# - steam... wine/proton under steam...
# - all the other package mangers, or self updating software you might use
#
# So lets just go with the "keep all the caches, maybe we'll need some of that data someday"

# exclude ssh private keys
/.ssh/id_*
